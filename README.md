# Dependencies-reader
 Dependencies-reader genarates the dependencies you have from your package.json or package.lock.json file into an excel sheet.

 Place your package.json or pacakge.lock.json in the source folder and replace the file string in index.js.

 PS: It is my updated fork of `alokraj68/package.json-dependency-reader.git`
